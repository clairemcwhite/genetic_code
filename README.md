# genetic_code

This is a project to search for English words in the proteomes of different organisms.  Proteins are made of amino acids, and each of the 20 canonical amino acids has a one letter abbreviation.

I downloaded a set of all English words, filtered for words which only contain amino acid abbreviations letters.  Words which contain B,J,O,U,X,Z are excluded. 

For each species, I generated a list of 4 letter or longer words found in its proteins
